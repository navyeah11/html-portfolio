<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! My name is Navya Srivastava. I am an Indian. My date of birth is 11th of September, 2005. I am currently a student of 
  Bachelor of Technology. I love travelling and making new friends. Some of my hobbies are reading, writing and singing.</p>

<p>I have been really enjoying web development so far. It has given me a lot of interest and entertainment to learn HTML and apply it
  to making my own websites. I am keenly looking forward to being much better in this and doing a lot more projects.</p>

<p>If you wanna know more about my personal life then I must say that I am an overly emotional and sensitive person who takes a lot of
  things to heart which is not a very good practise I know. Anyways, I am very close to my family and friends and I love them a lot. I kinda love myself
  too and I am currently content with whatever is happening in my life.
